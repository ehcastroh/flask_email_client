# **DATA-X:** <br> FLASK -- EASY WEB DEVELOPMENT FOR RAPID PRODUCT DEPLOYMENT.

<br>


<br>


**Author list:** Elias Castro Hernandez (**ehcastroh** is my handle for everything...linkedin, github, etc.)


**About (TL/DR):** The following collection of notebooks introduces developers and data scientists to web development using Flask. Flask is one of many available web server gateway interface (WSGI) tools that enable rapid and scalable websites and apps with a relatively accessible learning curve. The barebones capacity of Flask is particularly valuable when prototyping and iterating upon products, services, and machine learning applications. This collection of notebooks is part of [UC Berkeley's Data-X](https://data-x.blog/) curriculum.

**Learning Goal(s):** Gain an understanding of how to utilize available libraries and packages to quickly build products and services -- in real-life settings, using web-first methodology, driven by data, and end-to-end. In particular, learn how to build a bare-bones flask environment for handling Email automation tasks.

**Target User:** Data scientists, applied machine learning engineers, and developers

**Prerequisite Knowledge:** (1) Python, (2) HTML, and (3) CSS

### **CONTENT**

The following notebooks were created for UC Berkeley's Learn2Launch program. They are intended to provide a rapid introduction to common python visualization libraries, as well as introduce the user to more advanced visualization libraries and engines. The notebooks are structured into 3 parts.

  - Part_00_START_HERE_Flask_Email -- Serves as an overview of how to use the materials and what the goals of the notebooks are.
  - Part_01_Setting_up_Flask -- Fundamental overview of creating a basic Flask website.
  - Part_02_Setting_up_Email_Client -- Covers the process of linking PostgresSQL to Python libraries to create an email client.
  - Part_03_Deploy_Automated_Email -- Covers the details of quickly hosting Flask site using Heroku.
